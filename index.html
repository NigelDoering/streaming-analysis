	<p id="analysis-final" class="title">While all streaming services have high average ratings for all shows, as seen in the chart

			<p id="analysis" class="title">While Netflix has the most shows for those over 18, Hulu has a clear advantage for younger viewers.
				Prime Video lags behind in third for most categories, with Disney+ a distant fourth.</p>

			<h2 id="summary-title" class="title">Prime Time</h2>
			<p id="analysis" class="title">Prime Video makes a compelling case for nostalgic viewers with the most options for shows
				from before the 2000s. Meanwhile, Hulu and Netflix offer a plethora of modern options with Prime not far behind. Disney+ 
				continues to disappoint with less than stellar numbers. As to be expected with such a new service.

	<h2 id="summary-title" class="title">Disney+ Seizing the Moment</h2>
	<p id="analysis-final" class="title">Seen on the left, Netflix and Prime Video have had a strong upward trend in the total number of movies produced by year. 
		We see a lack of older movies, but a large increase in more modern movies. However, on the right we can see Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video have 
		had a decrease in quality of movies. Disney+ now makes it's strongest case for itself with a suprising upward trend in the quality of 
		newer movies, surpassing all other streaming services.</p>

	<h2 id="summary-title" class="title">Amazon's Anomaly</h2>
	<p id="analysis-final" class="title">Despite Prime Video's less than stellar performance in the last section, we have found that somewhat 
		surprisingly Prime Video has the highest percentage of movies with ratings over 8 as rated by IMDb.

	<div class="bg-last">
		<h2 class="title-last">Winner</h2>
		<p id="analysis-final" class="analysis-last">Despite the valiant efforts demonstrated by Prime Video and Hulu, Netflix emerges as the clear 
			winner. With an impressive amount of highly rated shows, an excellent repertoire of shows
			for each age group, and competitive numbers for older and newer shows, Netflix demonstrates the best all around statistics 
			for the different categories we looked at. Hulu and Amazon deserve an honorable mention for their mostly competitive numbers.
			Lastly, while Disney+ has disappointed us with it's poor performance until now, however their monopoly on a significant 
			amount of media puts them in a postion to challenge the supremacy of Netflix in the future. Happy Binging!
